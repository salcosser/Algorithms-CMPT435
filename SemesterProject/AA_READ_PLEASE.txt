Documentation For Pooled Testing Simulators. Because of the increased amount of time, I was able to build out two versions of runnning this assignment.
A simple command based runner, and a command line interface version for running multiple tests.

./launch quick 1000 .02             |           run a single simulation of 1000 people with a 2% random positivity
./launch quick 1000 .02 printAll    |           run a single simulation of 1000 people with a 2% random positivity, and print out the results of all of the simulated tests
./launch cli                        |           run the simulator with the command line interface
